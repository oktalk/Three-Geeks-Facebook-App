OVERVIEW

General Idea:
Three Geeks Facebook app was created by Eric Hemesath, Jeremy R. Geerdes, and Justin Stevens during a Web Dojo challenge at a Web Geeks event. The idea of the Three Geeks app is to show users how many of their Facebook friends are involved with a user group in Iowa.


To Do:

  • Back-end Dev --
      • Check user's friend list against all known Iowa user groups
  • On the front-end -- 
      • Section out all user groups
      • Show user group logo
      • Total count of members
      • Show percentage of how geeky your friend list
      • Visually display users geeky-ness in a chart or graph 
  • Other --
      • Do we handle friends that are in multiple user groups different?
      • Can we show how long a friend has been a member of a group
      • Add a button to share this app with your friends
      • Might be a good idea to display all available user groups even if the user does not know any members
      • Include link to member groups website, or Facebook group
      • Link each friend's photo and name to their Facebook page
      • Display each friend's statues (might need to show this on hover or truncate the copy to save space)
      • Ability to petition devs to add more user groups
